Taylor's Hypothesis
when advecting past a sensor, vortices/turbulence
patterns change so slowly that they can be
considered to be frozen while passing the sensor;
therefore, they are passing by with the mean flow
velocity!

Length of this structure is defined by r:
Therefore, the diameter of a structure can be
calculated with the mean velocity and a time span/
frequency
r = mean(u) / f

Integral length, represents the scale from which a time series
becomes uncorrelated
